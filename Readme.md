# Steve's Unreal Dialogue System (SUDS)

![SUDS Logo](Resources/Icon128.png)

## What Is It?

SUDS is a plugin for [Unreal Engine 5](https://unrealengine.com/) which allows you
to run dialogues in your game based on a script that you write in a text 
file.

Scripts look something like this:

SUDS has many features, including:

* Dialogue flow is expressed in a text file for a focussed writing experience
* Multi-line [speech](docs/SpeakerLines.md) support
* Player [choices](docs/ChoiceLines.md) with unlimited embedded responses
* Flow control via [goto](docs/GotoLines.md), [gosub](docs/GosubLines.md) and [conditional branching](docs/ConditionalLines)
* Persistent [variable state](docs/Variables.md)
* Send [events](docs/EventLines.md) back to code/blueprints with any number of arguments
* Supports all the [variable substitution and formatting features](docs/TextMarkup.md) in the same way Unreal does
* A convenient [in-editor testing tool](docs/Testing.md)
* [Localisation](docs/Localisation.md) support, including adding [translator comments](docs/LocalisationTranslatorComments.md)
* Easy integration with save games ([SPUD](https://github.com/sinbad/SPUD) or otherwise)

> SUDS was inspired by [Ink](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/) and
> [YarnSpinner](https://yarnspinner.dev/), but I started from scratch and 
> designed it specifically to integrate well with Unreal Engine. It also has a 
> number of differences to those systems, based on my own preferences and the 
> needs of my own project.
